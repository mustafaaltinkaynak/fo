ECHO(1)                    OpenBSD Reference Manual                    ECHO(1)

NAME
     echo - write arguments to the standard output

SYNOPSIS
     echo [-n] [string ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
     (` ') characters and followed by a newline (`\n') character, to the
     standard output.  When no operands are given, only the newline is
     written.

     The options are as follows:

     -n      Do not print the trailing newline character.

EXIT STATUS
     The echo utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     csh(1), ksh(1), printf(1)

STANDARDS
     The echo utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (``POSIX.1'')
     specification.

     The flag [-n] is an extension to that specification.

     echo also exists as a built-in to csh(1) and ksh(1), though with a
     different syntax.
